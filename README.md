Initial Implementation (First Snippet):
Dependencies Used:

Utilizes express, cors, and fs (file system) modules.
HTML views are rendered using the ejs template engine.
Handles CORS using the cors middleware.
Handles file operations like reading, writing, and deleting files synchronously using fs.promises.
Server Setup:

Creates an Express app.
Configures middleware for URL encoding, JSON parsing, and CORS.
Defines routes for file operations (read, write, delete) and user data operations (api/users).
Serves HTML pages for various operations using inline HTML within the route handlers.
Emulates file operations using Promises with the fs module.
Running the Application:

Requires Node.js installed.
Runs the JavaScript file using Node.js (node fileOperations.js).
Assumes the presence of .ejs files for rendering views.
Updated Implementation (Second Snippet):
Dependencies Used:

Uses express, method-override, mongodb, cors, and mongodb modules.
HTML views are rendered using the ejs template engine.
Manages CORS with the cors middleware.
Server Setup:

Creates an Express app.
Configures middleware for URL encoding, JSON parsing, method override, and CORS.
Connects to MongoDB using MongoClient.
Defines routes for CRUD operations on files (read, write, delete) and user data (api/users).
Renders views for file operations using .ejs files.
Performs CRUD operations on MongoDB collections for file and user data.
MongoDB Integration:

Connects to a MongoDB instance specified by the URI (mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/) using MongoClient.
Handles operations on MongoDB collections (users, files) to perform CRUD actions.
Running the Application:

Requires Node.js installed and a running MongoDB instance.
Runs the JavaScript file using Node.js (nodemon fileOperations.js).
MongoDB Compass can be used to visually inspect and manage the MongoDB collections (users, files).
MongoDB Compass:
Usage:
MongoDB Compass is a GUI tool to interact with MongoDB databases.
Allows visualization of databases, collections, documents, and schema.
You can connect to a MongoDB instance (specified by the URI) and explore/manipulate data.
Execution:
Initial Implementation (First Snippet):

Relies solely on Node.js and the application's JavaScript file.
The file operations are simulated using the file system.
Updated Implementation (Second Snippet):

Requires Node.js and a running MongoDB instance.
Connects to MongoDB to perform CRUD operations.
MongoDB Compass can be used to inspect and manipulate data stored in the connected MongoDB database.
